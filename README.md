Learning Django by hosting a Pokemon Knowledge Base.

## What?
I'm new to Django. This is my repo for learning it.

## What's the end result?
When this is done, this will essentially be a clone of Bulbapedia (or other tools like it).

## screenscraper.py?
This script culls data about Pokemon from Bulbapedia using BeautifulSoup4.
At the moment, it only generates the list of pokemon; no data is being siphoned
quite yet.
