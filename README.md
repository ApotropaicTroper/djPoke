What's going on?
================
Not much, how about you?


The following is information about what to do with this information.

## The Python Wheels
Install them.

## SQL Connector?
Install it. It's necessary before you install mysql-python from pip.

## The Scraper Script
Run it. Kind of the point of this whole thing. For now, anyway.

## Anything else?
The script depends on MariaDB 10.14. Install that, and, since MariaDB is essentially a *fork* of MySQL, you can 
`pip install mysql-python` it, as long as you've already installed MySQL-Connector/C 6.0.2 32-bit.

## Dependencies

- Python             2.7.11  32-bit
- MariaDB            10.1    32-bit
- MySql Connector/C  6.0.2   32-bit
- BeautifulSoup      4.4     (from pip)
- MySQl-Python       1.2.5   (from pip)
