What's going on?
================
Not much, how about you?


The following is information about what to do with this information.

# The Python Wheels
Install them.

# SQL Connector?
Install it. It's necessary before you install mysql-python from pip.

# The Scrubber Script
Run it.

# Anything else?
The script depends on MariaDB 10.14. Install that, and, since MariaDB is essentially a *fork*, you can 
`pip install mysql-python` it, as long as you've already installed MySQL-Connector/C 6.0.2.
